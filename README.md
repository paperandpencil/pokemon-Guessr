Navigate to https://paperandpencil.github.io/pokemon-Guessr/ in your browser

You have 1 minute (60 seconds) to identify as many pokemons as you can!

If you correctly identify (guess) the pokemon's name, congratulations! 
You will automatically get to see the next Pokemon, after one second.

If you guess wrong, the game will show you the Pokemon's name, for ONE second, before showing you the next Pokemon's image.
Hope you learn quickly, to match the image with the right name...
