# pokemon-Guessr
My first contact with frontend HTML CSS JS and a public API...

## Instructions to play
Requires a browser and an internet connection (because there is a JavaScript function that calls a public API)
Just download the 3 files into a single folder, and navigate to index.html
You have 2 minutes to identify as many pokemons as you can!

If you correctly identify a pokemon, you automatically get to see the next one.
If you get it wrong, the game will show you the correct name, but will NOT automatically show you the next pokemon. 
This is intentional, so take as long as you need to match image to name, before clicking the "next pokemon" button!

To reset the countdowntimer, you can refresh the page, and (probably) get different pokemons :D

## Notes
I was presented with an opportunity to acquaint myself to web app dev, thanks to 42's ft_transcendence v19.
And thanks to @cwijaya, for asking me to share the game with him! 
If one person asked for it, there might be another? ><
